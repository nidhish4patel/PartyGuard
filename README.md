# PartyGuard

This README can be used for setting up partyguard app into your android phone
INTRODUCTION
PartyGuard is an Android application. During a party at a fraternity house, if a woman faces any
problem, she can report about that issue to the fraternity members. She can report about various
problems like fights, someone is too drunk/sick,inappropriate behavior, and assaults of any kind. The
fraternity members can view the reported notifications and they will send the rescue team to the spot.
Separate to these other alerts, the emergency button feature will have a running timer and if the
problem is not solved within 15 minutes an alert message will be sent to campus police.
MOTIVATION
This project is done mainly for the safety of university women and help them during parties at any
fraternity.
